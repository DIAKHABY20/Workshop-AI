We start with 12 multiplied by 12, which equals 144.\\n2. Then, we take this new quantity (144) and multiply it by 12 again, resulting in 1728.\\n3. To complete the operation, we multiply the resulting number, 1728, by 12 one last time, yielding the final answer of 4096. \\n\\nThis demonstrates how the commutative property of multiplication in mathematics allows us to rearrange the order of operations and still obtain the same result. \\n\\nDo you have any other mathematical queries or concepts you'd like to better understand?
